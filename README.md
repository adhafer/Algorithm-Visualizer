Algorithm Visualizer
==========

This is a basic algorithm visualizer I wrote to learn React and Java Script as part of my Code-to-Learn journey. It is not completed and I will try to add more algorithms and oraganise the code.

__References:__  
I was motivated to start this project because of the following repositories: 
- [Pathfinding Visualizer](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer)


__To implement:__
* Algorithms: 
  - A* Algorithms
  - Recursive Division

* Animation for sorting algorithms.
